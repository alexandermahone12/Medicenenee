      <h2>My learning goal for this project is to learn how to program and gain more knowledge about the pharmaceutical area. I want to learn how to design a website using JavaScript (a programming language), which is easy to use, and contains a large database of medicines prescribed for various diseases. I will do enough research to help me design and publish the website on a server that will be working 24/7, which will lead to the website being available to anyone, anywhere and at any time. And the only requirement is an internet connection. I will have to communicate with large medical databases (such as UpToDate and PubMed) to use their database of medicines and information about them which will help me greatly while completing my database of medicines and the website.</h2>
